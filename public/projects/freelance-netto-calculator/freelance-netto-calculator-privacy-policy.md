# Privacy Policy

Last updated: February 18, 2026

Marcel Maatkamp ("we", "our", or "us") operates the **Freelance Netto Calculator** (the "App"). This page informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal data when you use our App and the choices you have associated with that data.

## 1. Information Collection and Use

The App is designed to perform financial calculations locally on your device. We do not collect or store your personal financial information on our servers.

### Types of Data Collected

#### a. Personal Data
While using our App, we do not ask you to provide us with any personally identifiable information that can be used to contact or identify you ("Personal Data"). All financial data you enter (such as revenue, costs, and tax settings) is stored **locally** on your device and is not transmitted to us.

#### b. Usage Data
We may collect information that your device sends whenever you use the App ("Usage Data"). This may include information such as your device's Internet Protocol address (e.g., IP address), device type, operating system version, the time and date of your use, and other diagnostic data. This data is primarily collected by third-party services as detailed below.

## 2. Third-Party Service Providers

We use third-party services that may collect information used to identify you.

*   **Google Play Services**: Used for the core functionality of the Android platform and app distribution.
*   **AdMob (Google)**: We use AdMob to display advertisements. AdMob may collect and use data such as device identifiers (e.g., Android Advertising ID) to show personalized or non-personalized ads. You can manage your ad preferences in your device settings.
*   **Google Play Billing**: If you purchase the "Pro" version to remove ads, transaction data is processed by Google Play. We do not see or store your credit card or payment information.

## 3. Data Storage

All user-entered data (e.g., income, expenses, screenshots of calculations) is stored locally on your device using Android's encrypted storage mechanisms where available. You are responsible for the security of your device.

## 4. Children's Privacy

Our App does not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal data, please contact us.

## 5. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last updated" date.
